        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I stumbled upon an intriguing &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://linearcam.city.fuefuki.yamanashi.jp/index.html?p=2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;website&lt;/a&gt; showcasing numerous web cameras operated by the Japanese government. Surprisingly, these cameras offer live feeds by refreshing a single image every 0.1 seconds. Initially, I thought this was a sign of governmental inefficiency or outdated IT infrastructure in Japan. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the underlying reasons may not be so simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more--&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is first published in the medium MPP plan. If you are a medium user, please follow me in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.huizhou92.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;medium&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Europe and the United States have long-standing systems, some of which have been running for decades. Similarly, these Japanese government web cameras were set up over 20 years ago, during a time when 56k dial-up and ADSL were the standard. Given the limited bandwidth of that era, using a 0.1-second image refresh to create a live feed was quite practical. The fact that this system has operated smoothly for over two decades speaks volumes about its stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;technological-progress-and-practical-compatibility&#34;&gt;Technological Progress and Practical Compatibility
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the span of just 30 years, we’ve witnessed massive transformations from the personal computer era to the mobile internet age. Consider the 1994 release of the original “The Need for Speed”:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.hxzhouh.com/blog-images/2024/06/04a2aae2338b42431292f66133d19705.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now compare it to the latest “&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UDpL-gb-FI&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Need For Speed: Unbound&lt;/a&gt;,” which features near-photorealistic graphics. This is a testament to the triumph of technological advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a tech professional, I initially assumed that government public service webcams should at least offer 1080p high-bitrate video or even VR capabilities. But is this really necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-human-touch-in-tech-choices&#34;&gt;The Human Touch in Tech Choices
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a small fraction of the global population uses the latest smartphones. Even if Apple sells 100 million iPhones a year, the total number in use might be around 500 million. At least 60% of people use devices that can’t handle high-definition video due to display and network limitations. The Japanese government’s seemingly clunky method of refreshing images every 0.1 seconds actually boasts the broadest compatibility, supporting devices from Windows 98 to the latest MacBook Pro. This approach ensures the widest reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-value-and-longevity-of-older-devices&#34;&gt;The Value and Longevity of Older Devices
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, we’ve accumulated many infrastructure and personal devices. This is a valuable asset. While new devices are more advanced, considering the compatibility of older devices when developing new products can extend their lifespan and avoid unnecessary waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-practical-benefits-of-low-tech-solutions&#34;&gt;The Practical Benefits of Low-Tech Solutions
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a train station in Niigata, Japan, which displays its departure times via a web camera focused on the station&amp;rsquo;s schedule board. This approach might seem “low-tech,” but it has numerous practical advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Cost&lt;/strong&gt;: No need for complex systems or apps; maintenance is simple and cost-effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wide Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Even basic 2G internet and older phones can display the schedule, ensuring information is widely accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advanced-isnt-always-better&#34;&gt;Advanced Isn’t Always Better
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When choosing technology for projects, practical considerations often outweigh pursuing the latest advancements. In many cases, the most successful projects are those that use the minimum viable product (MVP) approach to meet essential needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Needs&lt;/strong&gt;: Understand the target user’s requirements and device capabilities to select the most appropriate technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;: Evaluate the cost-benefit ratio and choose the most economically sensible technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainability&lt;/strong&gt;: Consider the long-term sustainability and maintenance costs to ensure stable, ongoing operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While technological advancements offer exciting possibilities, selecting the most suitable—not necessarily the most advanced—technology often yields the best results. This approach best uses existing resources and demonstrates a commitment to practicality and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Crafting Your Second Brain Lessons Learned from My Note-Taking Journey</title>

        <guid>https://huizhou92.com/p/crafting-your-second-brain-lessons-learned-from-my-note-taking-journey/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://images.hxzhouh.com/blog-images/2024/05/5ab6b54893dc2241704444526269572a.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Crafting Your Second Brain Lessons Learned from My Note-Taking Journey" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the past few years building my second brain, and here are some lessons I’ve learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frequent-switching-of-note-taking-softwareblogging-systems&#34;&gt;Frequent Switching of Note-Taking Software/Blogging Systems
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried EverNote, WizNote, VNote, CSDN blog, Google blogspot, WordPress, only to end up scattering my blogs across multiple corners of the internet. The solution? Going all in one. I’ve now settled on Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;constantly-switching-noteformats&#34;&gt;Constantly Switching Note Formats
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve experimented with txt, orgmode, markdown, rich text, and more, only to find myself frustrated with format conversions. Similar to the first point, each note system may not be universally compatible. The reason I chose Obsidian is for its markdown syntax. If need be, I can easily migrate it to any note system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mixing-fleeting-thoughts-with-truly-usefulnotes&#34;&gt;Mixing Fleeting Thoughts with Truly Useful Notes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleeting thoughts serve to capture a moment of inspiration, but it’s only meaningful if you revisit them within a day or two and turn them into useful, relevant notes. Without timely review, good ideas drown in a sea of whims. Most of our daily thoughts are insignificant and should be discarded, while those with potential significance must be identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mixing-project-notes-with-knowledge-notes&#34;&gt;Mixing Project Notes with Knowledge Notes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only recording notes relevant to specific projects leads to the loss of interesting insights or ideas during the project. The correct approach is to extract universal knowledge from projects. I recommend using the P.A.R.A method to organize notes. For more information on P.A.R.A, you can refer to this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsessive-note-organization&#34;&gt;Obsessive Note Organization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large pile of notes leads to an urge to organize knowledge, but too many attempts can affect the confidence to keep recording. The solution is to define the areas of interest and responsibility and not completely adopt a bottom-up knowledge management approach. When reaching the point of psychological pressure, use the MOCS (Maps of Content) method to organize notes (bidirectional linking is definitely worth trying). The most important aspect of a knowledge management system is to record your insights in one place, with the same format, and consistent standards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
